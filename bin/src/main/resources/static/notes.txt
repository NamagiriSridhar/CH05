Future improvements
-------------------

*** If only one check box was selected and text box taco name was empty , 
checkbox stays selected when errors get displayed. How is this the case?
*** If more than one check box was was selected and text box taco name was empty , 
checkboxes does not stay selected when errors get displayed. This makes sense however
*** Option flour tortilla & corn tortilla should be radio buttons not check boxes(not now)
*** gotta verify - when including jpa conversion is automatic - you can pass objects in forms - they 
will get converted from strings to objects automatically?
** some final - some not why??? why use final?
** since Lombak provides constructors, why write constructors?

JPA 
*** They have many to many relationship between order and tacos. It should be one to many?



Info
******
Passing ingredients as an array of strings vs array of ingredients
 Processing design: Taco(id=null, createdAt=null, name=richard, ingredients=[FLTO, SLSA, SRCR])
 Processing design: Taco(id=null, createdAt=null, name=LoveWins, ingredients=[Ingredient(id=SLSA, name=Salsa, type=SAUCE), Ingredient(id=SRCR, name=Sour Cream, type=SAUCE)])

 
 logging.level.org.springframework=TRACE in application props for a detailed trace
 
 disable dev tools to prevent constant execution
 
 logger vs system.out.println (i dont need logger)

 Just comment annotations if you dont something to be detected . say @component in converter
SOP Taco(id=null, createdAt=null, name=richard, ingredients=[Ingredient(id=FLTO, name=Flour Tortilla, type=WRAP), Ingredient(id=GRBF, name=Ground Beef, type=PROTEIN), Ingredient(id=TMTO, name=Diced Tomatoes, type=VEGGIES), Ingredient(id=LETC, name=Lettuce, type=VEGGIES)])
